  Description: ABYSSWORKER is a malicious driver used in MEDUSA ransomware attacks
    to disable EDR systems. The driver masquerades as a legitimate CrowdStrike Falcon
    driver and provides extensive capabilities to terminate processes, remove security
    callbacks, manipulate files, and disable security tools. It uses stolen certificates
    from Chinese companies and requires a specific password for activation. The driver
    was observed being deployed alongside HEARTCRYPT-packed loaders and provides attackers
    with kernel-level capabilities to blind EDR products by removing notification
    callbacks, detaching mini-filter devices, and replacing driver major functions.
  Usecase: Elevate privileges
