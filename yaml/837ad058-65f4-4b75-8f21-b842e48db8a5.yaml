  Description: The Carbon Black Threat Analysis Unit (TAU) discovered 34 unique vulnerable
    drivers (237 file hashes) accepting firmware access. Six allow kernel memory access.
    All give full control of the devices to non-admin users. By exploiting the vulnerable
    drivers, an attacker without the system privilege may erase/alter firmware, and/or
    elevate privileges. As of the time of writing in October 2023, the filenames of
    the vulnerable drivers have not been made public until now.
  OperatingSystem: Windows 10
  Privileges: kernel
  Usecase: Elevate privileges
